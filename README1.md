# AlaCarte

## Welcome to AlaCarte

AlaCarte was created for lovers of all things food, allowing users to browse a wide variety of recipes, explore new ingredients, and find new inspirations for even the most common dishes. Users who sign up are granted the ability to create their own recipes as well as their own collections to store their favorite recipes to view at a later time.

## How is it built?

AlaCarte is formed using a React frontend, a Python backend, and PostgreSQL as its database. 

## Frontend Technologies 

### React

AlaCarte is an application that is built using React and React libraries.

### Redux

Redux handles the state for the application, including thunks that make fetches to the API routes in the backend.

## Backend Technologies

### Python/Python3

AlaCarte was built using the most recent backend language I had learned at the time, making it a great experiment. Its ability to pair with Flask made the query process incredibly smooth and manageable.

### Flask

Flask was the ORM of choice because it simplifies the workflow of making backend requests and querys

## Future Implimentations

AlaCarte is off to an incredible start, but there is always room to improve. I will be adding a few new features including granting users the ability to leave comments on recipes, a rating system for users to make better decisions on available recipes and their popularity, and a search feature which will allow users to find recipes by title, user, and category.

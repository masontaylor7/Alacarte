Reheat 4 cups of consome. Once it comes up to a boil, lower the heat to a simmer and keep the lid on. \n 2. In a large frying pan set over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil. When the oil is hot and rippling, but not smoking, dip a tortilla into the consomé, covering both sides with it. Fill the tortilla with 2 tablespoons birria meat and 1 tablespoon cheese. Transfer it into the hot pan, don’t fold it in half yet. Once the bottom of the tortilla turns lightly golden brown, fold it in half. Cook both sides until the cheese is melted and the tortillas are a deeper golden brown. Cook 2 to 3 tacos at a time following this process and adding more oil to the pan, as needed. \n 3. Transfer the tacos onto a plate and serve with the onions and cilantro scattered on top and lime wedges on the side. Provide each guest with a small bowl of warm consomé for dipping. Enjoy!The best birria tacos are freshly made, but leftover tacos and consomé can be tightly covered and refrigerated, separately, for up to 3 days. To reheat, simply place the tacos on a pan over medium-low heat and cover with a lid. Warm them up for 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Reheat the consomé separately in a small saucepan. "

Line the bottom of a 9 x 5-inch loaf pan with 4 or 5 paper towels or a folded, clean kitchen towel. Place the tofu on top, centered in the pan. Top it with another stack of paper towels or kitchen towel. Nestle in a second loaf pan so it sits right on top of the towel-covered tofu. Fill the top pan with 3 canned goods or any heavy items that’ll fit. Let sit for 30 minutes or up to an hour. The towels should be saturated, and the tofu should feel much drier to the touch. \n 2. Arrange a rack in the center of the oven and preheat it to 425°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat and spray it generously with cooking spray. \n 3. In a medium bowl, add the soy sauce, vegetable oil, sesame oil, rice vinegar, and sugar. Whisk together with a fork or small whisk until the sugar is dissolved, about 30 seconds. In a small bowl, combine the cornstarch, breadcrumbs, salt, and black pepper and mix. Set both bowls aside. \n 4. Remove the tofu from the press and place it on a cutting board. Set the tofu up on its longest side and slice it lengthwise into 2 thin rectangles. Lay them flat on top of each other and make 3 equal cuts lengthwise followed by 2 cuts crosswise, making 24 equal cubes. \n 5. Add the cubed tofu into the marinade and use a rubber spatula or large wooden spoon to gently toss them to evenly coat. Be careful not to break up the tofu. It’s okay if there’s a little marinade left in in the bowl. \n 6. Add the breading over the marinated tofu and toss gently but thoroughly, coating the cubes on all sides. You might have some crumbs stuck to the bowl; you can discard them or toast them in a small pan to serve on top of the crispy tofu. \n 7. Scatter the tofu on the prepared baking sheet an inch or so apart from each other. Spray the tops generously with cooking spray. Bake until the tofu is browned and crispy, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve warm. Refrigerate leftovers for up to 4 days. I don’t recommend freezing crispy tofu. Reheat in a nonstick pan over medium heat with a little oil or in a 350°F oven until warmed through."

In a ghablama, wok, or large sauté pan set over medium-high heat, add the onions. Sauté them, without any oil for about 4 minutes, until they soften, keeping a lid on as much as possible to trap steam. It’s okay if they brown around the edges. If they start charring, lower the heat and continue stirring. Stir in the oil and reduce the heat to medium. Continue to sauté for about 2 minutes, until the onions are tender and translucent. \n 2. Cut off the stem and thinly slice 1 Anaheim pepper. Add the sliced peppers, tomato paste, curry powder, advieh, felfel, black pepper, and turmeric to the cooked onions.

Do not move them until they start to char, then turn them every 2 to 3 minutes to char them all over. This will create some peppery smoke, so open your windows! \n 5. Transfer the gholpi onto a serving platter, being careful not to break or smash the florets. Set the charred peppers on top and serve warm with barbari or lavash.

The sauce will reduce and thicken, and the tteok will look glossy. When cooked properly, the tteok is a little chewy, tender, but not mushy. You should be able to cut it with a gentle wiggle with the side of your spoon. \n 5. Stir in the sesame oil. Taste the sauce and adjust seasoning with more soy sauce or sugar. The sauce should be flavorful and a little sweet to balance out the spiciness. \n 6. Transfer the tteokbokki to a serving platter. Sprinkle the sesame seeds all over and serve it with the hard-boiled eggs. The perfect bite: Blanket a tteok with a piece of onion and cabbage. Dunk the whole thing into the sauce.

In a small saucepan, combine the piloncillo, cinnamon stick, cloves, and 1 cup water. Set it over high heat and bring it to just under a boil—large bubbles should start to form around the edges. Immediately reduce the heat to low, stirring constantly to dissolve the sugar. Once the sugar has dissolved, remove the saucepan from the heat and let the mixture cool to room temperature. \n 2. Thoroughly wash the outside of your pineapple with running water making sure to remove all the dirt and debris. \n 3. Place the pineapple on a large cutting board. Use a sharp chef’s knife to slice the crown- and root-end off and discard them. Stand the pineapple upright on its flat base so that it doesn’t roll around. Starting from the top, slice off the skin, leaving about 1/4 inch to 1/2 inch of fruit attached. Cut the skin into 2- to 3-inch pieces. Place them into a nonreactive (glass, stainless steel, or ceramic, but not plastic) container that can hold at least 3 quarts. With the pineapple still upright, cut off the edible part, working around the core. Cut the core into 1-inch chunks and place them in the container with the skin. The rest of the pineapple is for you to enjoy! \n 4. Add the cooled syrup and the remaining almost 2 quarts filtered water. Stir to combine. \n 5. Cover the container with a clean cheesecloth or tea towel. Use a rubber band to secure it. Place the container in a warm spot away from sunlight. The ideal temperature is between 70°F and 80°F. \n .6 If the spot is warm (over 85°F), check the tepache after 12 hours. Wait at least 24 hours if it’s cooler. Small bubbles will begin to form around the top edges as it ferments. Use a slotted spoon to remove any white foam on top; it is harmless. More bubbles will form over time, and the mixture will smell a little sour, like beer. You can taste it at this point with a spoon or a straw—stick it into the liquid and cover the top of the straw with a finger to trap the liquid in the straw. The ideal taste comes down to your preference—some batches will taste sweeter, funkier, or more sour than others. At the ideal temperature, it takes about 2 days for the tepache to reach the perfect balance of sour, sweet, and light carbonation. If cooler, it can take up to 5 days. \n 7. Set a nut bag or fine mesh strainer lined with cheesecloth over a large nonreactive bowl or jug. Strain the tepache into it. Let it sit for about 15 minutes to fully drain and discard the fruit. \n 8. Serve the tepache over ice and garnish with a slice of pineapple. Tepache can be refrigerated for up to 1 week. Do not cover it tightly. It will continue to ferment even in the fridge, so if stored for any longer, it will turn into vinegar."

You can skip this step if you’re using ground cinnamon. In a small pot, cover the cinnamon stick with 1 cup of water. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. Once the water comes to a rolling boil, turn the stove off and let the cinnamon stick steep for 10 minutes. \n 2. While the cinnamon is steeping, give the rice a quick rinse under cold water. This will remove excess starch from the surface of the grains. Strain off any excess water before adding the rice to your blender. \n 3. Pour the steeped cinnamon water, along with the cinnamon stick (or add the ground cinnamon), into the blender with the rice and the remaining 5 cups of water. Blend just until the grains of rice begin to break up, or about 1 minute. \n 4. Pour most of the mixture into a large bowl. Swish around the remaining rice water in the blender carafe to try and remove any rice that may remain after the first pour. Add it to the container with the rest of the rice water. Try to retrieve as much of the rice as possible from the blender. Do not add fresh water to try and remove any remaining rice. It will dilute the flavor of your drink. \n 5.

Preheat the oven to 450°F. Lightly oil a baking sheet or spray with vegetable oil. Sprinkle lightly with corn meal. \n 2. Flour a work surface. Place the ball of pizza dough on top and flatten it with your hands into a circle, around 1-inch thick. Dimple it with your fingers to help spread it out and cover it with a dishtowel. Let it rest while you cook the bacon to allow the gluten to relax for easier shaping. If using no-knead dough, you may want to knead in 1 to 2 tablespoons of flour if the dough is very slack (wet.) \n 3.

Combine the lettuce, red pepper, cucumber, tomatoes, and scallions in a large serving bowl. Set aside. \n 2. Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a medium or large heavy-bottomed skillet over high heat. When the oil is hot, add the corn. Season corn with 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until blackened in spots and tender, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate. \n 3. Sprinkle the taco seasoning and 1/2 teaspoon salt over the surface of the chicken, rubbing it in and coating so chicken is fully seasoned. \n 4. In the same skillet used to cook the corn add 1 tablespoon of olive oil and set over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the chicken and cook until deeply brown along the bottom and the flesh turns opaque about halfway up the side, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip the chicken and continue cooking, until brown on the second side and fully cooked through, another 3 to 5 minutes. \n Transfer the cooked chicken to a cutting board. Once it is cool enough to handle, cut into bite-sized pieces. \n 6. Make the salad dressing: Place the lime juice, vinegar, honey, cumin, salt, pepper, cilantro, and olive oil into a blender and blend until smooth. Add 1 tablespoon of water, if needed, to get the blender going. Alternatively, make this dressing by hand. Finely chop the cilantro and place in a medium bowl. Combine all salad dressing ingredients and whisk until smooth. \n 7. Finish and serve: Add the corn and chicken into the bowl with the salad ingredients. Crumble the tortilla chips over the top. Add about two-thirds of the dressing and toss to lightly coat. Add more dressing and toss again, if needed. Divide salad into 4 bowls, top with crumbled Cotija cheese, and serve."
